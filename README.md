# 10A_headline_analysis_week0-

The project's main objective is to analyze a dataset made up of international news
stories that were gathered using the NewsAPI in recent months. The objective is to do
sentiment analysis, correlation analysis, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) across
global media agencies.
Key Objectives:
1. Environment Setup and Version Control: To guarantee efficient development
and cooperation, the project starts with configuring a Python environment,
version control using Git, and continuous integration/continuous deployment
(CI/CD).
2. Project Planning and EDA: Using the CRISP-DM framework as a guide,
candidates use exploratory data analysis to gain a deeper understanding of the
structure and content of the dataset. This includes ranking the top and bottom
websites according to the number of news items they include, as well as
high-traffic websites, the number of news organizations in each country, and the
amount of news coverage each country receives.
3. Sentiment analysis: To classify news stories according to their level of
positivity, negativity, or neutrality. They evaluate how sentiment is distributed
among websites and investigate how sentiment and regular news reporting
affect website rankings.
4. Correlation Analysis: To identify possible linkages and insights, additional
analysis looks at correlations between different parameters, such as sentiment,
website traffic, and the frequency of news reports.

Approach:
● Data Loading and Preparation: Load and preprocess the dataset using Python
programming, taking care of any missing values and guaranteeing consistency.

● Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examine important aspects of the data, spotting
trends, patterns, and outliers using statistical analysis and visualization
approaches.
● Sentiment Analysis: Using natural language processing (NLP) tools, applicants
examine the tone and sentiment distribution of news story titles to gain insights
regarding media agencies.
● Correlation Analysis: To gain important insights, candidates examine correlations
between various factors, such as website traffic, sentiment, and the frequency of
news reports, using statistical methodologies and visualizations.
Outcome:
● A thorough analysis report that summarizes the conclusions and revelations
from the sentiment, correlation, and EDA analyses.
● supporting the study with statistical summaries and visualizations that help in
understanding and interpreting the data.
● insights on the worldwide news media scene, including major players, prevailing
sentiments, and possible relationships between various elements.
